--I was given 2 separate sheets. One with the User's Level and One without.
--One was a sheet with all of the personnel that received the survey and the other represents who Completed it.
--I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the user level and overall rating. 
--No correlation was found and some of the names required data cleaning,
--for some of the names on the recall list didn't match the ones on the survey.
--Since the Names don't match, their level won't as well.
